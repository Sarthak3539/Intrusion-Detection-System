# Intrusion-Detection-System

Developed an Intrusion Detection System using a machine learning pipeline to identify malicious network activity. Applied EDA for feature extraction and selection. Implemented and compared classification algorithms, including logistic regression, XGBoost, random forests, and voting ensemble. Achieved a 4% accuracy improvement using SELU as the activation function in ANN
